Project-based Exam (EEE100_17F)

HELLO THERE!

We all know that a common stopwatch is a handheld timepiece designed to measure the span of time which elapses between its activation and deactivation. Typically, it is used in sporting events and laboratories. But in this case, my group made a simple stopwatch design for windows server gadgets. It is a software program that keeps track of elapsed time between two events that replicates the real thing. This was developed for people out there who need a stopwatch in an instant.

The designed Stopwatch contains features that are commonly seen in the handheld stopwatch. Moreover, this Project-based Exam additionally has a code for Date & Time that make the project not to look plain and only focus on stopwatch features. The group suggested and agreed to put Date & Time for additional feature that can be shown upon running the program to the window display of any windows server gadget that is applicable to run a python code.

Since the designed stopwatch is a python code, if you want to download and run the code to your PC or Laptop, it is recommended to have or install a Python 3.7.9 version and make sure that the gadget is in Windows server for the compatibility of the code and run smoothly without facing errors. We personally do not know if the code will run to other gadget server like Mac, Linux, etc., that is why we recommend Windows server gadgets for better experience.

This is our first time to make a Stopwatch code, so please bare with us because we are still learning the world of programming, but this experience was a good start for us that we can keep for future uses.

Thank You.
